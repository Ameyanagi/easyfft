# constfft
A Rust library crate providing an [FFT] API for arrays. This crate wraps the
[rustfft] and [realfft] crates that does the heavy lifting behind the scenes.
Use `constfft` if you're working with [arrays], i.e. you know the size of the
signal at compile time.

### Advantages
* If it compiles, your code **won't panicâ„¢** in this library\*
* Ergonomic API

### Current limitations
* Requires nightly because it uses the [generic_const_exprs] feature
* No caching of the intermediate context/structs required to do the fft calculation
* Even/Odd bounds don't seem to propogate back up the call chain (TODO: Add
  example and link to rust issue)
* No implementation for slices
* No documentation

### Possible future plans
Currently I don't see any reason why the same API (minus the compile time size
checks) cannot be implementable on slices. This seems like a much nicer API to
work with and AFAICT does not depend on the types to be arrays. If this is the
case I'd implement the same API on slices and rename this crate to `easyfft`.

#### Footnotes
\* While this could be true in theory, in practice it most probably is not.
Currently you can create a `RealDft` struct and mutate it using the `DerefMut`
trait in a way that the `real_ifft` method will cause a panic. This should be
fixable in a future patch release currently pending implementation details.
There could be other bugs in this crate or it's dependencies that may cause a
panic, but in theory all the runtime panics have been moved to compile time
errors.
